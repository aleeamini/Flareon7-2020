this is very simple:
at first when run the fidler.exe file, it shows a password box \n the password checker function is a simple.\n copy the password_check in a new file and run it with python and print the 'key' value\n
you should see the password: "ghost"

@Second phase:\n
ww should earn 200000000000 coins from this game. evey time we click on the cat, it gives us a coin so we should click on the cat 1000000000 times. :D
if you look at the fidler.py code you see a function :cat_clicked() that increases coin at every run one time. so just we should change the 1 to 100000000000 and save the file.\n
but for run the game we can not use the fidler.exe because it is a exe python. but we can install "pygame" to run the main .py files. 
so after run the changed fidler.py and click on the cat two times we have the flag.
