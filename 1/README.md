# 1-Fidler
## First Part:
this is very simple
at first when run the fidler.exe file, it shows a password box \n the password checker function is a simple.\n copy the ```password_check()``` in a new file and run it with python and print the 'key' value: "ghost".

## Second phase:
We should earn 200000000000 coins from this game. evey time we click on the cat, it gives us one coin. so we should click on the cat 200000000000 times. :D
If you look at the fidler.py code you see a function: ```cat_clicked()``` that increases coin at every run one time. so just we should change the 1 to 100000000000 and save the file.

but for run the game we can't use the fidler.exe because it is a compiled exe python.but we can install "pygame" package to run the game as a py file. 
so after run the changed fidler.py and click on the cat two times we have the flag.
